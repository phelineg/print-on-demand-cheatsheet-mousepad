# print-on-demand-cheatsheet-mousepad

This repository features a variety of images designed to be used for printing programming cheat sheets on mugs, stickers, mousepads, and more.

While these images can be utilized for both personal and commercial purposes, I recommend primarily using them for personal projects, such as creating your own custom programming gear or as gifts for friends and family.

### Example Shop
You can see an example of this collection in action at this Etsy shop: [Virtual Mugs](https://virtualmugs.etsy.com)

### Print-On-Demand Partner

The designs in this collection were created to be compatible with *Printful*, but they should work well with any print-on-demand service that supports similar formats.

### Image Creation 

The images were designed using Canva, with dark mode images specifically featuring a background color of #2C2C2C. When printing dark mode items, be sure to use this color as the background for optimal results.
